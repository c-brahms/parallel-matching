# Bit-Parallel Algorithms for Symbolic Music Pattern Matching

This repository contains algorithm implementations for the following paper:

Antti Laaksonen and Kjell Lemstr√∂m: Parallelising the Polyphony: High-Performance Algorithms for Music Pattern Matching. In: 17th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR 2025)

The algorithms have been implemented in C++, and they have been used in our experiments.
